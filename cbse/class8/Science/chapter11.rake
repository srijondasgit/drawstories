What does the distance moved by an object in unit time indicate? You also know that a moving object like a ball rolling on the ground slows down. Sometimes it may change its direction of motion. It is also possible that the ball may slow down and also change its direction. Did you ever wonder what makes an object to slow down or go faster, or change its direction of motion?',
                    'Let us recall some of our everyday experiences. What do you do to make a football move? What do you do to make a moving ball move faster? How does a goalkeeper stop a ball? How do fielders stop a ball hit by a batsman? A hockey player changes the direction of the moving ball with(a)a flick of the stick (Fig. 11.1). In all these situations the ball is either made to move faster or slower or its direction of motion is changed.',
                    'We often say that a force has been applied on a ball when it is kicked, pushed, thrown or flicked. What is a force? What can it do to bodies on which it is applied? We shall seek answers to such questions in this chapter.',
                    '11.1 Force â€“ A Push or a Pull Actions like picking, opening, shutting, kicking, hitting, lifting, flicking, pushing, pulling are often used to describe certain tasks. Each of these actions usually results in some kind of change in the motion of an object. Can these terms be replaced with one or more terms? Let us find out.',

Once we release the pressure on the bulb, water gets filled in the dropper. The rise of water in the dropper is due to - (a) pressure of water (b) gravity of the earth (c) shape of rubber bulb (d) atmospheric pressure',
