One such trip took them to the river Ganga in Rishikesh.They climbed the mountains of the Himalayas, where it was very cold. They saw many kinds of trees on these mountains â€” oaks, pines and deodars,very different from the ones near their home on the plains! In yet another trip, they travelled to Rajasthan and moved on camels through the hot desert. They collected different kinds of cactus plants from this trip. Finally, they went on a trip to Puri and visited the sea beach, dotted with casuarina trees. While recollecting all the fun that they had on these trips, a thought struck them. All these places were so different from one another, some were cold, some very hot and dry, and some places so humid. And yet all of them had many organisms (living creatures) of various kinds.',
