There are many aspects of unequal situations in a market and poor enforcement of rules and regulations. Hence,there is a need to sensitise learners and encourage them to participate in the consumer movement.This chapter provides case histories â€” how some consumers were exploited in a real-life situation and how legal institutions helped consumers in getting compensated and in upholding their rights. The case histories would enable the students to link these narratives to their life experiences. We have to enable students to understand that the awareness of being a well-informed consumer arose out of consumer movement and active participation of people through their struggles over a long period. This chapter also provides details of a few organisations helping consumers in different ways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues of the consumer movement in India.',
